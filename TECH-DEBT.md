# Tech debt

Deferred work and known gaps specific to this repository (Fragments & Unity).
Record an entry here whenever you defer something, rather than leaving it only in
a commit message or in chat. Keep entries short and dated. Live items live under
the "Current Items" heading as `### <id> <title>` sections. Once an issue has
been resolved, remove its `### <id> <title>` section from Current Items below —
but never remove its row from the Ledger table at the bottom of this file; see
"Ledger" below.

Framework-level tech debt — anything under the synced `src/tools/`,
`src/templates/`, `scripts/`, `editors/`, or `docs/` — belongs in the `poetic`
framework repo's `TECH-DEBT.md`, not here.

Format:
```
### <id> <short title>

A description of what, why it matters, where, and a suggested fix.

```
Where `<id>` is a literal "TD" then the date followed by a zero-padded
sequential number (starting at 1 for the first entry of a day). I.e.:
**TD*YYMMDDNN***. `NN` is one more than the highest `NN` already used for
that date **in the Ledger table**, not just what's currently visible above
it — a resolved entry's body is removed, but its Ledger row stays forever,
so the Ledger (not memory or scrollback) is the source of truth for the next
free ID. Compute it with `scripts/next-tech-debt-id.pl` rather than counting
by hand.

## Claiming an item

Before starting work on an open item, confirm nobody else already has:
check its Ledger row is `open` (not `in-progress`), and skim open pull
requests for its ID. Then:

1. Flip its Ledger row's Status to `in-progress`.
2. Push a branch and open a **draft** pull request right away — before the
   fix is finished — so `gh pr list` shows it's claimed. The first commit
   can be the Ledger status flip itself.
3. Do the work, pushing further commits to the same branch/PR.
4. Once verified, flip the Ledger row to `resolved` (fill in `Resolved` and
   `Ref`), remove the entry's `### <id>` section from Current Items, and mark
   the PR ready for review.

If a claim is abandoned (the draft PR is closed without merging), flip the
row back to `open`.

## Current Items

The open and in-progress items, each as a `### <id> <title>` section. This
heading is permanent: when there are no current items it stays here (empty), so
it is always obvious where a new item's body belongs.

<!-- Add new items directly below, as `### <id> <title>` sections. -->

## Ledger

Every tech-debt ID ever allocated — open, in-progress, resolved, or not-debt —
is listed here forever, in ID order. This is what makes numbering unambiguous:
the next free ID for a given date is one more than the highest `NN` seen
below for that date, regardless of whether the corresponding entry still has
a body above.

A row can also close as `not-debt`: the item was filed here but turned out, on
reflection, not to be a deferred cost at all. Its `### <id>` section is removed
like a resolved one, but nothing was fixed, so the `Resolved` column stays
blank; the `Ref` column instead points to wherever the content moved.

| ID | Title | Status | Resolved | Ref |
|----|-------|--------|----------|-----|
