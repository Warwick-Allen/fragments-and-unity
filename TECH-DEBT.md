# Tech debt

Deferred work and known gaps specific to this repository (Fragments & Unity).
Record an entry here whenever you defer something, rather than leaving it only in
a commit message or in chat. Keep entries short and dated. Live items live under
the "Current Items" heading as `### <id> <title>` sections. Once an issue has
been resolved, remove its `### <id> <title>` section from Current Items below —
but never remove its row from the Ledger table at the bottom of this file; see
"Ledger" below.

Framework-level tech debt — anything under the synced `src/tools/`,
`src/templates/`, `scripts/`, `editors/`, or `docs/` — belongs in the `poetic`
framework repo's `TECH-DEBT.md`, not here.

Format:
```
### <id> <short title>

A description of what, why it matters, where, and a suggested fix.

```
Where `<id>` is a literal "TD" then the date followed by a zero-padded
sequential number (starting at 1 for the first entry of a day). I.e.:
**TD*YYMMDDNN***. `NN` is one more than the highest `NN` already used for
that date **in the Ledger table**, not just what's currently visible above
it — a resolved entry's body is removed, but its Ledger row stays forever,
so the Ledger (not memory or scrollback) is the source of truth for the next
free ID. Compute it with `scripts/next-tech-debt-id.pl --ref origin/main`
(after a `git fetch origin`) rather than counting by hand — the `--ref` makes
the allocation reflect the shared state instead of a possibly stale checkout.
It still cannot see IDs allocated on unmerged branches, so also skim open
pull requests and `td/*` branches when filing.

IDs are only unique within this repository: sister repositories allocate from
the same date-based sequence, so the bare ID may exist in several of them.
When referring to an item anywhere outside this repository (a sister repo's
docs, a cross-repo PR, chat), qualify it with the repo name — e.g.
`fragments-and-unity TD26072001`.

## Claiming an item

This repository is worked by concurrent agents: autonomous and interactive
sessions may pick up items at the same time, so a claim must be checked and
taken against the shared state, never against what a local checkout happens
to say. Before starting work on an open item:

1. `git fetch origin`, then confirm the item's Ledger row is `open` (not
   `in-progress`) **as of `origin/main`** — e.g. via
   `perl scripts/get-tech-debt-record.pl --ref origin/main <id>`.
2. Confirm nobody holds a claim: `git ls-remote origin "refs/heads/td/<id>"`
   must print nothing, and skim open pull requests for the ID (which also
   catches claims made on unconventionally named branches).
3. Create the claim branch, named exactly **`td/<id>`**, from `origin/main`;
   flip the item's Ledger row Status to `in-progress`; commit and push. The
   branch name is the claim lock: git refuses the push if the branch already
   exists, so a rejected push means another agent won the race — abandon
   quietly; never force-push over it.
4. Open a **draft** pull request right away — before the fix is finished — so
   `gh pr list` shows the claim too. The Ledger status flip can be its first
   commit.
5. Do the work, pushing further commits to the same branch/PR.
6. Once verified, flip the Ledger row to `resolved` (fill in `Resolved` and
   `Ref`), remove the entry's `### <id>` section from Current Items, and mark
   the PR ready for review.

If a claim is abandoned, close the draft PR and delete the `td/<id>` branch —
that releases the lock. The in-progress flip only ever lived on the branch,
so `main`'s Ledger still says `open` and nothing needs reverting.

## Current Items

The open and in-progress items, each as a `### <id> <title>` section. This
heading is permanent: when there are no current items it stays here (empty), so
it is always obvious where a new item's body belongs.

<!-- Add new items directly below, as `### <id> <title>` sections. -->

## Ledger

Every tech-debt ID ever allocated — open, in-progress, resolved, or not-debt —
is listed here forever, in ID order. This is what makes numbering unambiguous:
the next free ID for a given date is one more than the highest `NN` seen
below for that date, regardless of whether the corresponding entry still has
a body above.

A row can also close as `not-debt`: the item was filed here but turned out, on
reflection, not to be a deferred cost at all. Its `### <id>` section is removed
like a resolved one, but nothing was fixed, so the `Resolved` column stays
blank; the `Ref` column instead points to wherever the content moved.

| ID | Title | Status | Resolved | Ref |
|----|-------|--------|----------|-----|
