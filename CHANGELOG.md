# Changelog

All notable changes to the Poetic framework are recorded here.
Patch-level fixes and routine documentation updates are omitted unless they
affect behaviour visible to poem authors or site publishers.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Blogger publishing** — optional automatic publishing of poems to a Blogger blog on push to `main`, enabled per-repo via `blogger_sync=true` in `.poetic-config`. Includes a new GitHub Actions workflow (`Sync to Blogger`), the `sync:blogger` and `blogger:auth` npm scripts, JS injection into the Blogger theme template (via `npm run build:blogger`), and a setup guide at `docs/BLOGGER.md`.
- **Stale artefact warnings** — `npm run build:yaml` now warns when the YAML directory contains `.yaml` files with no corresponding active `.poem` source; `npm run build:poems` warns when `public/` contains `.html` files with no corresponding YAML source.

### Changed

- `poem-to-raw.js` is now a pure shell wrapper; the outdated pure-JavaScript
  fallback has been removed.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `sync-framework.sh` no longer prints commit instructions when no files were
  changed by a sync.
- `poem-to-raw.sh` now correctly expands variables defined in `.poem` files.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Standalone poem pages** — each poem is built as a full styled HTML document
  at `public/<slug>/index.html`.  The old flat URL `/<slug>.html` is kept as a
  redirect stub forwarding to the new URL.
- **Shared Audiomack loader** (`public/poetic.js`) — a single delegated `click`
  listener replaces per-poem inline `loadAudiomackPlayer` functions; audio
  buttons now use `data-*` attributes instead of `onclick`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- Initial public release of the Poetic framework.
- **`.poem` syntax — trailing text rule**: trailing text on any line-anchored
  token (dividers `----`, end markers `====`, segment labels `{...}`, block
  comment markers `<<#` / `#>>`, literal block markers `<<<` / `>>>`, version
  labels) is explicitly ignored, enabling inline comments
  (e.g. `----  # end of first version`).
- **Build pipeline**: `.poem` → YAML → HTML via Pug template (`npm run build`).
- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh`** — pulls framework-owned files from the
  upstream `warwickallen/poetic` repo and records the synced ref in
  `.poetic-version`.
- **`.poetic-config`** — user-owned settings file supporting `favicon`,
  `subtitle`, `skip_paths`, `auto_sync`, and `sync_schedule`.
- **Scheduled auto-sync** via GitHub Actions (opt-in via `auto_sync=true` in
  `.poetic-config`).
- YAML `date` field uses ISO format (`yyyy-mm-dd`) for reliable string sorting.
- Analysis content uses blank-line paragraph separation; the build converts
  blank lines to `<p>` tags automatically, so `<p>` tags are not needed in the
  YAML source.
